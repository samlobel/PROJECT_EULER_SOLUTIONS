So, the question we're trying to solve here is 
(a/b)(a-1)/(b-1) = 1/2

Interesting.

First of all, it really asymptotes to sqrt(0.5), obviously. But it's a question
of exactitude.

One needs to be above and one needs to be below. But if it's on it exactly
it's not gonna be right.

It could also be a thing about factoring.
